# Text Your Way
text-to-find-routes is a simple app written in Python and using Twillio and Google Maps API. 

Mohammad (https://github.com/zarifi) came up with this simple, yet unique idea.

When the app is running, find directions between two locatons by sending a text to: +1 289-301-2434 (This is a Canada registered number)

The body of text should have the following format:

FULL ORIGIN ADDRESS (INCLUDE CITY AND COUNTRY) , FULL DESTINATION ADDRESS (INCLUDE CITY AND COUNTRY)

Example: Sysdney Town Hall, Sydney Opera House

Note: Comma is only use to seperate origin and destination, do not use comma anywhere else.

The app would be helpful to people who do not have internet on their mobile, but need directions.
